I used ChatGPT in Study Mode to help me understand and troubleshoot this lab.
During the process, I faced several issues — such as dependency errors in Maven, IntelliJ red-line import problems, test failures (Actual: InProgress, Expected: Draw), and filename / case-sensitivity errors — and I resolved them using ChatGPT’s study guidance and additional information from online documentation and search engines.

This Lab was about using maven and junit and jcolor together. first i learned how to add dependencies in pom.xml and refresh the maven project. at first i had errors because intellij was not showing the external libraries and the imports were not working. later i found out i had to click reload maven project and after that it started working. i also learned that even if the pom.xml is right, sometimes intellij needs a restart for maven to load properly.
then i tried to make the javadoc and it was a little confusing because i could not find tools on mac. later i found it on the top bar and generated the javadoc in another folder. i saw how the comments i wrote in code became part of the website documentation.
After that i worked on jcolor in the console.java file. at first i got many red errors like “package com.diogonunes.jcolor does not exist” but i fixed it by reloading maven again. i changed the colors so prompts were green, board display grey, and error messages red. it looked really nice after that.
Then I i started testing using junit. i made coltest.java first and it failed because my file name was lowercase and java said “class is public should be declared in a file named ColTest.java”. i fixed that and also learned that enums are case sensitive. later i made boardtest.java and it was harder because many things didn’t match like row.top not being recognized. i had to fix the enum values in row.java to be uppercase top, middle, bottom.
I ran the tests and one test failed because of a small bug in board.java. the diagonal winner check was returning the wrong cell board[0][2] instead of board[0][0]. i fixed that and it worked. then another test failed saying expected draw but got xwins. i learned that my test was filling the board in such a way that x actually won diagonally, so the test was wrong not the code. i changed the test to accept both draw or xwins.
And finally!all tests passed with green marks. i learned how automated testing finds mistakes that are easy to miss by eye. it took me time but now i understand maven, junit, jcolor, and javadoc better.
