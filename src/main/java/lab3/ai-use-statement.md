# AI Use Statement

I used ChatGPT (Study Mode) as a learning aid to better understand how to design and organize my TicTacToe lab according to the course requirements.
The AI was used only for guidance and clarification, not to generate my full code.

Specifically, ChatGPT helped me:

Understand how to properly separate code into the game, ui, and main packages.

Learn when and why to use methods such as hasWon(), isFull(), and toString().

Discuss safe input validation and correct game loop order (move → win → draw → switch).

Review whether my current code structure meets the lab’s design goals and rubric.

All final implementation decisions, logic, and typing of the Java code were done by me.
