AI Tools Used:
I used ChatGPT (Study & Learn Mode) to help me understand JavaFX concepts and the Lab 6 requirements.
I did not use AI to generate my final code or to complete the lab for me.

Purpose of AI Use:
I used AI only for learning support, including:

Understanding how JavaFX event handling works

Understanding layout panes (BorderPane, GridPane)

Understanding how to attach CSS files

Understanding scene graphs and GUI structure

Clarifying how to connect my existing Lab 5 logic to the Lab 6 GUI

Getting explanations of CSS vs Java transitions

Learning proper folder structure for CSS resources

Getting guidance on building a button-based TicTacToe interface
