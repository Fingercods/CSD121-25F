🧠 Notes

Today I made my first TicTacToe game in Java.
It was fun but also a bit confusing at first.

I learned how to make more than one class and how to use packages like game and ui.
I found it hard to understand how to connect all the files together but later I used ChatGPT learning mode and it helped me step by step.

The easiest part was making the board and checking who wins.
The most difficult part was taking the input from players and making it work with both numbers and letters.

I learned about using final Scanner, toString() method, and how to make methods like hasWon() and isFull().

Playing the game in the console was cool because it actually felt like something real I made.
In my opinion TicTacToe is a simple but nice game to learn logic and loops.
