# developer journal – lab1

### day 1
set up repo and intellij.For first time running java here. wrote a basic main function in class.

### day 2
added age check func (isAdult). learned to return boolean. this part of java felt very simple and similar to me .

### day 3
 had an infinite loop as i used while instead of if. fixed that. also realized using while+break is of no use if i just need to run once.

### day 4
noticed i was repeating survey code in both adult and minor blocks. restructured into askSurvey() function. looks way cleaner now.

### day 5
added try/catch around input parsing + file writing. no more crashes when user type letters instead of numbers. also file errors handled.

### day 6
final cleanup: added javadoc, comments . pushed changes to github. ready to show instructor.
